*how it all began ðŸŒŸ*

The Pool is an intense 4-week immersion on the School 21 campus with other selected candidates. During these 4 weeks, we checked my motivation to become a world-class programmer, found out if we were ready for #CodingTime and checked: do we like what we do.

It was a very interesting experience
Ð•his repository is dear to me as a memory. Because this was my first programming experience and I wanted to keep my first attempts at coding.

Sometimes I like to see where I started, it's funny
